			<h3>planit - An interactive calendar to connect families</h3>
			<p>We wanted to connect families virtually when physically being with each other is not an option. We explored the possibilities of bringing as close to a physical experience as possible to the homes of our close friends and families. Planit acts as central hub of virtual connections at home that can connect to other devices that are sharing experiences with you and your family.</p>
			<h3>My Role</h3>
			<p>We had a very tight team and had to spend a lot of time on finalizing the purpose of this project. Within my team I was mostly involved in figuring out the levels of interactions that is going to be involved in this interface. I was part of the prototyping team in where we used Flash Catalyst as a tool for building the prtotype. I was also involved in the making of the video by capturing the footage and editing the video.</p>
